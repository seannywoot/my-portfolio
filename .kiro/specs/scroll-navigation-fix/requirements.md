# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current landing page has a scrolling navigation issue where the Hero Section scrolls too far forward, resulting in an empty screen before users can scroll down to the Marquee Section. The intended flow should be: Landing Page → Horizontal scroll to Hero Section → Hero Section Content Fully shows → Vertical scroll to Marquee Section. Currently, there's a gap or empty space that appears between the Hero Section and Marquee Section transitions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the portfolio website, I want the scrolling navigation to be smooth and continuous without empty screens, so that I can seamlessly experience the content flow from landing page to hero section to marquee section.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls from the landing page THEN the system SHALL transition horizontally to the Hero Section without showing empty space
2. WHEN the Hero Section is fully visible THEN the system SHALL allow vertical scrolling to continue to the Marquee Section
3. WHEN transitioning between sections THEN the system SHALL maintain visual continuity without gaps or empty screens

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Hero Section to be properly positioned and fully visible when the horizontal scroll completes, so that I can see all the hero content before continuing to scroll vertically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the horizontal scroll animation completes THEN the Hero Section SHALL be fully visible and properly positioned
2. WHEN the Hero Section is displayed THEN all hero content (title, description, buttons, stats) SHALL be visible within the viewport
3. WHEN the user continues scrolling THEN the system SHALL transition smoothly from horizontal to vertical scrolling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the scroll calculations to be accurate and responsive, so that the navigation timing works correctly across different screen sizes and scroll speeds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating scroll progress THEN the system SHALL use accurate viewport height measurements
2. WHEN determining scroll phases THEN the system SHALL properly calculate transition points between landing, hero, and marquee sections
3. WHEN the user scrolls at different speeds THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth transitions regardless of scroll velocity
